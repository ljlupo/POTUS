# POTUS files
POTUS is a training data set that I created about ten years ago when building informatica. Since then I've used it for multiple training purposes inclusing, learning to use GIT and GITHUB

The data set include President of the United States (POTUS), their spouce (FLOTUS if any) and the Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS) seperated out by terms in office. POTUS is an time constrained office of leadership, not a person, which is an important distinction.

Understanding that currently (2021) there have only been male POTUS office holders, the term FLOTUS (First Lady...) will more than likely need to be updated at some point in the near future.
